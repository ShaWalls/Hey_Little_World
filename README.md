# Hey_Little_World
Hello world, with no twist.
I have been fumbling around the internet for about a month now trying to decipher these Arduino boards (UNO to be precise). 
Seems my brain doesn't work like most others, as I am having one L of a time putting all these pieces together.
Hopefully being here and reading and writing code more often will be the remedy to what ails me.
I'll catch you all (y'all) on the flipside!
